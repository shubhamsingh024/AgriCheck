# AgriCheck
A smart agriculture web application using soil moisture and raindrop sensors, with a dashboard for monitoring sensor data and suggestions
I have given all codes including Arduino ide code.
The hardware required are:
## Hardware Requirements

To run the **AgriCheck** project, you'll need the following hardware components:

1. **Arduino Uno** (or compatible):
   - Used to interface with the soil moisture and raindrop sensors.
   - Sends sensor data to the PHP web application via a Python script.

2. **Soil Moisture Sensor**:
   - Measures the moisture level in the soil.
   - Output is used to determine whether the soil is dry, moist, or wet.

3. **Raindrop Sensor**:
   - Detects the presence of rain.
   - Helps determine whether the environment is wet due to rainfall.

4. **Jumper Wires**:
   - For connecting the sensors to the Arduino.

5. **Breadboard** (optional but recommended):
   - For easy and secure sensor connections.

6. **Power Supply**:
   - Provides power to the Arduino and sensors.
   - Typically, a USB cable can power the Arduino Uno.

7. **Laptop/PC**:
   - For running the web application, including the PHP server and the MySQL database.

8. **Wi-Fi Module (optional for remote data transfer)**:
   - If you need to send data remotely or want the Arduino to communicate over Wi-Fi, you may need a module like the **ESP8266** or **ESP32**.

Ensure that your components are properly connected and that your Arduino is configured to send sensor data to the PHP web application using the appropriate Python script.
